      The team had several challenges during the project. During his time there Fredrik worked on
      many different topics like cookie consent management, traffic migration (migrated customers),
      setting up company wide test systems as well as many more. Fredriks biggest contributions to
      the team was introducing monitoring and alerting. The added transparency enabled them to find
      a lot of previously unknown bugs not only within the team but throughout the platform.
      Furthermore, Fredrik designed and implemented a permission management module to allow for easy
      and extensible permission checks throughout the different microfrontends. Last but not least,
      Fredrik helped the team become more efficient by improving their agile processes. Through the
      introduction of several quality gates and focus on clear acceptance criterias and collective
      alignment on what to achieve both functionally as well as technically, the team went from
      being regarded as one of the worst performing teams to being one of the best, even inspiring
      other teams to review their own processes.
