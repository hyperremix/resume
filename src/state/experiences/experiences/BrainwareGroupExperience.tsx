  roleDescription:
    "The company had a relatively small development team and was struggling to keep up with customer demands while still trying to innovate their products. Fredrik was hired to relieve some of this pressure by being part of mostly new projects but also helping with bug fixing and general development. The most significant projects where the implementation of a command-line tool GUI, the migration from SourceSafe to git and the Elasticsearch integration. The command-line tool GUI was initially Fredrik's own idea, to help the development team with easy debugging of the numerous command-line tools. However, it didn't take long before the true potential was seen and more and more features where implemented. The GUI is now used throughout the whole company. Since the company was created, the version control system that has been used is Visual SourceSafe. Because of the bad experiences with branching and merging in SourceSafe, they absolutely abandoned that workflow. This in turn made parallel work completely impossible, which sometimes choked the development for days. In order to solve this, Fredrik introduced the team to git and implemented a new workflow and branching model. It has been used with great appreciation and success to this day. All products that brainwaregroup provides have a way of searching for information. In some cases, the search queries where suffering from performance issues. In order to provide a better user experience, Fredrik was supposed to mirror the database in Elasticsearch. The searches where then sent to Elasticsearch instead of the database, which provided nearly instant search results.",
