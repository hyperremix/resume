      to the website. CDON+ is a paid membership that gives customers free shipping on every
      purchase above SEK 100 and a way to collect points that are translated into a gift card at the
      end of a year. Fredrik was involved in all parts of the project, including planning, database
      design, business logic implementation as well as GUI design.
