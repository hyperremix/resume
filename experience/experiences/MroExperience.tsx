        'A new team called Developer Experience was formed to improve the speed and quality of development across all other teams. During his time there, Fredrik developed concepts for easy application testing with Cypress, introduced Helm to facilitate reproducible deployments in an OpenShift environment, and helped set up SonarQube and Snyk to enhance code quality. He also implemented several Golang-based Prometheus exporters, a custom Usabilla-Jira connector using Kotlin, Quarkus, and GraalVM, and a secure method for handling secrets in microservices with HashiCorp Vault. To promote these tools and processes, Fredrik wrote documentation, blog posts, and conducted lightning talks. He occasionally joined other teams to assist them in adopting new concepts and tools.',
